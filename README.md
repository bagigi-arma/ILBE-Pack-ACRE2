# ILBE Assault Packs for ACRE2 - Bagigi Repack

This is a repack of the [ILBE Assault Pack + Retexture (ACRE)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1841281075) mod for Arma 3, made because the original presented some issues and didn't appear to still be supported.

The repack is available [on the Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3065316263).

Any changes from the original's latest version, as of 21st Aug 2019, can be viewed in the commit tree.

Like the original mods, this re-release is licenced using the [Arma Public License Share Alike (APL-SA)](https://www.bohemia.net/community/licenses/arma-public-license-share-alike).
