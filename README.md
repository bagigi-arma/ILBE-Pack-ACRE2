Big thanks to them for their great work.

I've taken the liberty of altering the radiopack weight (80=>40) to be in line with vanilla bags, all packs have 240 maxload which is also in line with vanilla.
Bacon's textures are applied to all 4 models for more variety.

I take no credit for the actual content of this mod, this is just to give more radiopack variety to ACRE users while
fixing the excessive mass of the packs (was 3.6Kg without the radio inside, now 1.8Kg).

As per the original mod, this release is Arma Public License Share Alike (APL-SA).
